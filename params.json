My major is in Web Development, but the program gave all students a solid foundation in various areas of Information Technology such as, networking, software, and security practices. I am a very motivated person and have a passion for learning as much as I can about new and existing web technologies. I try to surround myself with other people who share the same passion so we can trade ideas and thoughts in our career field.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
